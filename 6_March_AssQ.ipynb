    "Measures of central tendency and variability are used in statistics to describe the main features of a dataset, including its central location and spread. Some common measures of central tendency and variability include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by summing all the numbers in the dataset and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency because it takes into account all of the data points in the dataset. However, it can be sensitive to outliers and is not always a good representation of the \"typical\" value in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data is arranged in order. The median is a useful measure of central tendency because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. The median is particularly useful when the data is skewed or has extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when there is a clear \"peak\" or mode in the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. The range is a useful measure of variability because it provides a simple way to describe the spread of the data. However, it can be sensitive to outliers and does not take into account the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and standard deviation: Variance and standard deviation are measures of the spread or variability of a dataset. Variance is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is a useful measure of variability because it takes into account the distribution of the data and is widely used in statistical analyses. However, it can be sensitive to outliers and may not accurately describe the spread of non-normal distributions.\n",
