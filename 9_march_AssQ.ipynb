    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both ways of describing the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which can take on a countable set of values. It gives the probability of each possible value of the random variable. Mathematically, the PMF is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) = Pr(X = x)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable and x is a possible value that X can take on. For example, if X is the number of heads obtained in two flips of a fair coin, then the PMF would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "x      |   0    |   1    |   2\n",
    "----   |--------|--------|--------\n",
    "P(X=x) |  1/4   |  1/2   |  1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the PMF gives the probability of obtaining 0, 1, or 2 heads in two coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF, on the other hand, is used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a certain range. It gives the probability density at each possible value of the random variable. Mathematically, the PDF is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = d/dx F(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "where F(x) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which gives the probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to x. For example, if X is the height of a randomly selected adult male, then the PDF might be a normal distribution with mean 5'9\" and standard deviation 2 inches:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = (1 / (2 * pi * 2^2)^(1/2)) * exp(-(x - 5'9\")^2 / (2 * 2^2))\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the PDF gives the probability density at each possible height of an adult male. The probability of a male being exactly 5'9\" is 0, since the height is a continuous variable and can take on an infinite number of values.\n",

    "In summary, the PMF is used for discrete random variables, while the PDF is used for continuous random variables. Both functions describe the probability distribution of a random variable, but in slightly different ways."
